# Knowledge Graph of Physics Textbook

This project creates a knowledge graph for a physics textbook using Python. It utilizes `pandas`, `networkx`, and `matplotlib` to visualize the relationships between chapters and subtopics in the textbook.

## Project Overview

The knowledge graph represents the structure of the textbook, connecting each chapter to its respective subtopics, and shows how they are related. The graph is built using data from pandas DataFrames and visualized using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

### Key Features:
- Nodes represent chapters and subtopics.
- Edges define the "belongs to" relationship between chapters and subtopics.
- Visualization of the entire graph to illustrate the textbook's structure.

## Running the Project
Clone the repository.
Install the required packages (listed above).
Run the Python script to generate and visualize the knowledge graph.
Sample Output
The output is a visual representation of the knowledge graph with nodes labeled by the chapter/subtopic names and edges representing the "belongs to" relationships.

## Visualization
Using networkx and matplotlib, the knowledge graph is displayed with:

- Nodes colored in light blue.
- Labeled edges showing relationships.
- Spring layout for arranging nodes.
